 <h2>Tips to get better at the game</h2>
 <ol> 
<p>Use the Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner (British Airways) this is really good for acceleration and handling it is very good for beginners.</p>
 <p>Use 7 to start moving, then when you get enough speed hit the down arrow or put your cursor down and you will take off!</p>
 <p>Try to get use to flying by using autopilot then you will get better.</p>

 <h1>Minefun.io</h1>
<h3>so minefun has many modes so Karthik can do some of them </h3>
<ol>
<p> one of them is infection</p>
<p>in infection you have to shoot zombies and if you are a zombie you have to get
others</p>
<p> or war where you spawn with a akm and can 
unlock new gun</p> 
<p>or you could do parkour 
where you have to jump from stuff  to other stuff</p>
<p> also sky wars where you have to fight on island above the sky to 
get first place </p>

<h1> kour.io<h3>
<p>its a good gun game to play but it can get very swetty</p>
<p> there is multiple mode like kourcarft</p>
<p>In kourkarft you have gameplay like Fortnite but in kour witch makes it a good game to play </p>
<p> or FFA where its you agiansit the world it bit hard so if you dont like go to TDM</p>
<p>where you have your team and you ethier have to kill or capture the flag so it could be better than 
the FFA game mode since you have to keep your team safe and work together </p>
<hr>
<ol>
<h1>Sword masters</h3>
<p>in sword masters you have to fight monsters with our sword</p>
<p>you can level up and get new swords t become the best  one in the game </p>
<p> and you can unlock new worlds later on so its a grind type of game </p>

<h1>smash carts</h3>
<hr>
<ul>
<p>In smash carts you can friend people</p>
<p>and also you can pick maps but after that</p>
<p>you can actually start fighting people with your items that you get by running into squares</p>
<p>with the items you can shot or place them to either do damage or kill the other people who you are fight with</p>  
<p>Its a battle royal game but you might get broad fast with slow updates </p>
<p>also you can have different skins or carts</p>
